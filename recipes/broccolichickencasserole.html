    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 pound broccoli florets, cooked</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup dry stuffing mix</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts in a large pot and add enough water to completely cover the chicken in liquid; bring to a gentle simmer. Cover tightly with a lid and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the pot and cut into bite-sized pieces when cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Mix together condensed soup and mayonnaise in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Layer chicken in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer cooked broccoli over top, then soup mixture, and finally Cheddar cheese. Sprinkle dry stuffing mix over top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and cheese has melted, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>For a creamier version, use more cheese and an extra can of soup!</p>
